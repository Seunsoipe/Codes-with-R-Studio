This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
data("AirPassengers")
class(AirPassengers) #This tells you that the data series is in a time series format
start(AirPassengers) #This is the start of the time series
end(AirPassengers) #This is the end of the time series
frequency(AirPassengers)  #The cycle of this time series is 12months in a year
summary(AirPassengers) # metrics of passengers min, max, mean, 1st and third quartiels
plot(AirPassengers) #This will plot the time series
```

```{r}
cycle(AirPassengers) #This will print the cycle across years.
boxplot(AirPassengers~cycle(AirPassengers)) #Box plot across months will give us a sense on seasonal effect
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

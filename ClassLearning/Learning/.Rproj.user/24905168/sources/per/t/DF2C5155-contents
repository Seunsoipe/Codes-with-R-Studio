This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
data <- read.csv("USA_cars_datasets.csv")
head(data)
```

```{r}
cor(data$price, data$year)
#caciulating Correlation of price and year
```

```{r}
#To create 2 Vectors x and y
x <- c(2,3,4,5,6)
y <- c(10,12,11,12,13)
linearMod <- lm(y~x)
print(linearMod)

#meaning y = 0.6x + 9.2
```


Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

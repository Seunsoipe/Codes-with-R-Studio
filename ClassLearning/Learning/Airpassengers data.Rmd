This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
data("AirPassengers")
```

```{r}
class(AirPassengers)
```

```{r}
start(AirPassengers)
end(AirPassengers)
```

```{r}
frequency(AirPassengers)
summary(AirPassengers)

```

```{r}
plot(AirPassengers)
```

```{r}
plot(AirPassengers, col = 'blue')
```

```{r}
cycle(AirPassengers) #This will print the cycle across years.
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

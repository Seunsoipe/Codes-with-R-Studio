This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(FactoMineR)
library(factoextra)
```

```{r}
harper_df <- read.csv("http://programminghistorian.org/assets/correspondence-analysis-in-R/HarperCPC.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```

```{r}
harper_df
```

```{r}
harper_table <- table(harper_df$abbr, harper_df$membership)
harper_table
```

```{r}
harper_table <- harper_table[,colSums(harper_table) > 1]
CA_harper <- CA(harper_table)
plot(CA_harper)
```

```{r}

```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

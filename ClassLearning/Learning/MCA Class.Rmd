This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(FactoMineR)
data(poison)
```

```{r}
res.mca <- MCA(poison, 
              quanti.sup = 1:2, # Supplementary quantitative variable
              quali.sup = 3:4,  # Supplementary qualitative variable
              graph=FALSE)
```

```{r}
eig.val <- res.mca$eig
barplot(eig.val[, 2], 
        names.arg = 1:nrow(eig.val), 
        main = "Variances Explained by Dimensions (%)",
        xlab = "Principal Dimensions",
        ylab = "Percentage of variances",
        col ="steelblue")
```

```{r}
fviz_mca_biplot (res.mca, repel = TRUE)
```

```{r}
fviz_mca_biplot (res.mca, repel = TRUE, 
                 ggtheme = theme_minimal())
```

```{r}
fviz_mca_var (res.mca, choice = "mca.cor",
            repel = TRUE, 
            ggtheme = theme_minimal ())
```

```{r}
fviz_mca_var(res.mca, col.var = "cos2",
             gradient.cols = c("#00AFBB", "#E7B800", "#FC4E07"), 
             repel = TRUE, 
             ggtheme = theme_minimal())
```

```{r}

```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
